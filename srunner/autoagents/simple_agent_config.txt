This is the configuration file of the human agent. This agent incorporates two modes.
The log mode parses the controls given to the vehicle into a dictionary and records them into a .json file.
This file can be read by the playback mode to control the vehicle in the same way, resulting in a deterministic agent.
The file name can be chosen, and is the second argument of this config file.
